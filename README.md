### Purpose: ###
The purpose of this project was to create a fun interactive app while allowing me to expand upon my Web Development skills.


* Deepened knowledge of **DOM** and its **manipulation**.
* Improved **CSS Grid** understanding and usage.
* Greatly improved **functionality** in general (shortened, optimized and reusable functions).
* Instead of prompt, I added three grid size options for **better UX** and **UI**.
